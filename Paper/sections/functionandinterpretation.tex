\section{Function and interpretation}
\label{sec:functionandinterpretation}


As \parencite[365--366]{Olsen2015} puts it, ``compounds do not overtly express the grammatical or conceptual relations that exist between their constituents and are, consequently, inherently ambiguous'', but that ``compounds with plural and phrasal first constituents are not uncommon''.

This is, in our view, distinct from the question of whether non-head constituents in compounds can establish referents of their own, which \textcite[366]{Olsen2015} denies but \textcite{Dressler1987} demonstrates is possible.
