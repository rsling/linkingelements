@ARTICLE{Schaefer2016c,
  ABSTRACT = {Over the past decade, multifactorial corpus-based explorations of alternations in grammar have been prominently used to support theories and frameworks within cognitively oriented corpus linguistics. For example, prototype theory as a theory of similarity-based and inherently probabilistic linguistic categorization has received support from studies showing that alternating constructions and items often occur with probabilities influenced by prototypical semantic or contextual factors. In this paper, I analyze a low-frequency alternation effect in German noun inflection in terms of prototype theory, based on strong hypotheses from the existing literature that I integrate into an established theoretical framework of usage-based probabilistic morphology, which allows us to account for similarity effects even in seemingly regular areas of the grammar. Specifically, the so-called weak masculine nouns in German, which follow an unusual pattern of case marking and often have characteristic lexical properties, sporadically occur in forms of the dominant strong masculine nouns. Using data from the nine-billion-token DECOW12A web corpus of contemporary German, I demonstrate that the probability of the alternation is influenced by the presence or absence of semantic, phonotactic, and paradigmatic features. Token frequency is also shown to have an effect on the alternation, in line with common assumptions about the relation between frequency and entrenchment. I use a version of prototype theory with weighted features and polycentric categories, but I also discuss the question of whether corpus data can be taken as strong evidence for or against specific models of cognitive representation (prototypes vs. exemplars).},

  ABSTRACT = {We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

  ABSTRACT = {Significance testing has been controversial since Neyman and Pearson published their procedure for testing statistical hypotheses. Fisher, who popularized tests of significance, first noticed the emerging confusion between that procedure and his own, yet he could not stop their hybridization into what is nowadays known as Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). Here I hypothesize why similar attempts to clarify matters have also failed; namely because both procedures are designed to be confused: their names may not match purpose, both use null hypotheses and levels of significance yet for different goals, and p-values, errors, alternative hypotheses, and significance only apply to one procedure yet are commonly used with both. I also propose a reconceptualization of the procedures to prevent further confusion.},
