This is the README file for data package and paper LaTeX/knitr sources.

1. To replicate the full analysis, you have to get some large data
   files (if you checked this out from Github). To download them,
   type the following in Bash (MacOS or GNU/Linux - or hypothetically
   Windows with Bash and POSIX tools) after descending to this
   folder:
```
   Data/get_bigfiles.sh
```
2. You can check how the count files and other data bases were
   generated by checking out the following Bash scripts:
``` 
   Data/Database/make_counts.sh
   Data/Database/make_data.sh
   Data/Database/make_real_blacklists.sh
```
   This is usually not required, however. The generated files
   are included in the distribution, and it takes a long time
   to re-generate them.

3. To see how we did the data generation for the corpus study
   and creation of stimuli, check the following file:
```
   Data/R/all.R
```
4. To check how we analysed the split-100 experiment in R, see
   this file:
```
   Data/Split/Rlinkexp/Analyse.R
```
5. To see how we integrated the data into the main paper, see
   the knitr sources including the make file:
```
   Paper/leglossa.Rnw
   Paper/Makefile
```
